# Alexandria - Library Management Software

Alexandria is a C# .NET Framework 4.8 Windows Forms application for library management made as part of the faculty undergraduate studies course "Software Engineering". The application was implemented by the joint efforts of my colleagues: [Luka Bojka](https://github.com/lbojka) and [Petar Å iljeg](https://github.com/piljeg). Alexandria showcases the use of EF 6 for data access, implementation of Three Tier Architecture (Presentation, Business and Data Layer), Repository and Unit of Work Pattern.

This fork of the repository consists of:

- Completed and refactored implementation of the Repository Pattern
- Completed and refactored implementation of the Unit of Work Pattern
- User's password hashing and salting
- Overall refactoring of the application
